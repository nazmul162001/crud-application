## Project Description

* At first users need to create an account for getting accesss in this website. Because Admin dashboard is a privet route. Without login No one can access dashboard page.
* If users do not want to create a new account they can use user credentials that I provide in the login UI page
* After successfully login users redirect to admin dashboard home page. Here users can see total summery of student, course, payment & users count. (Currently I make students count dynamics only, too soon I will make dymaic all section)
* In Student route users can see Total students list. In here users can add new student by clicking ADD NEW Student Button.
* Also users can Delete or Update any users information by clicking Delete or Update icon
